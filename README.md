This folder has code for all the programming assignments for INF 553 Foundations And Application of Data Mining at USC for the Fall 2017 semester. The following give a brief description of each of the assignments. Programming assignments were implemented using Scala.

Homework 1:
Homework 1 is a warm up for using spark. In this assignment, I completed two tasks. The goal of these two tasks is to get familiar with Spark and do data analysis using Spark. 

Homework 2:
In this assignment, I implemented the SON Algorithm to solve every case on top of Apache Spark Framework. I found all the possible combinations of the frequent itemsets for any given input file that follows the format of the MovieLens Ratings Dataset ml-1m. The goal of this assignment is to apply the frequent itemset algorithms on a large number of data and make implementation more performant and efficient in a distributed environment.

Homework 3:
This assignment contains two parts. First, I implemented a Model-based Collaborating Filtering(CF) recommendation system using Spark MLlib. Second, I implemented an Item-based CF system without using a library. The datasets I used are the MovieLens datasets. The goal of the assignment is to make me understand how different types of recommendation systems work and more importantly, try to find a way to improve the accuracy of the recommendation system myself.

Homework 4:
In this assignment, I implemented Hierarchical Clustering The data set is UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.html. The goal of this assgnment is to understand how to clustering the given data using Hierarchical Clustering method.

Homework 5:
In this assignment, I finished the Girvan-Newman algorithm using the Spark Framework in order to detect communities, implemented betweenness and modularity according to the lecture by myself without using any third-part package. The goal of this assignment is to understand how to use the Girvan-Newman algorithm to detect communities in an efficient way by programming it within a distributed environment.
